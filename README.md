# What

Create voice datasets in the lj-speech format.(1)
Export your dataset and use it to train a model with [Coquiüê∏ TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS)

# Quickstart

Choose the directory where you would like to retrieve your exported dataset.
Use that path as the first argument to (-v) the volume option in the docker run command below

`docker run -p 8000:8000 -v /path/to/your/export/dir:/app/backend/projects echokeeper`

# Containerized Setup

See quickstart

# Manual Setup

1. Whisper requires the command-line tool [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [`portaudio`](http://portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs/index.html) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:

```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
sudo pacman -S portaudio

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg
brew install portaudio

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```

3. Install the backend and frontend environmet `sh install_playground.sh`
4. Run the backend `cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && flask run --port 8000`
5. In a different terminal, run the React frontend `cd interface && yarn start`

# Work in Progress

[] Allow users to pass in custom prompts
[] Track duration of recordings
[] In export_metadata_txt(), create the third column of the ljspeech format, per Keith Ito's spec

Metadata is provided in transcripts.csv. This file consists of one record per line, delimited by the pipe character (0x7c). The fields are:

    ID: this is the name of the corresponding .wav file
    Transcription: words spoken by the reader (UTF-8)
    Normalized Transcription: transcription with numbers, ordinals, and monetary units expanded into full words (UTF-8).
